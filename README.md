# Jack Kennedy's CV

My CV is available at [here](https://jcken95.github.io/CV/kennedy-jack.pdf).

I built this with R Markdown and [{vitae}](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) using the [AwesomeCV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template.

It's mostly just text, but I wrote a small API function with [{httr}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html) to grab my stats from my [Crossvalidated profile](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/283201/jcken). They're updated every time I rebuild the document.
